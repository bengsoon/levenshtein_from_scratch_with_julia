# Levenshtein From Scratch with Julia

Levenshtein distance and ratio calculations are considered to be "edit distances" -- it is an algorithm that is used to fuzzy-match two strings.

I have decided to use Julia instead of Python as it has been a language I have been wanting to pick up... So I thought what other better way is out there to learn it other than by starting to code in it?
